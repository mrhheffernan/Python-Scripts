# PythonApps: A collection of scripts in development

## VEGAS adaptive Monte Carlo add ons

###### vegas_tests.py
This script demonstrates the different ways of performing multidimensional integration in VEGAS and shows the advantages over SciPy for naive nesting.

###### vegas_returns.py
In large-volume applications, sometimes VEGAS objects are returned in two different data types, making this hard to handle directly. This script provides functions for calling the mean result and the estimated error for both types, solving this issue.
